Introduction\n\n__Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM):__  RBMs are shallow neural nets that learn to reconstruct data by themselves in an unsupervised fashion.  \n\n\n\n#### 1.1 How does it work?\n\nSimply, RBM takes the inputs and translates them to a set of numbers that represents them. Then, these numbers can be translated back to reconstruct the inputs. Through several forward and backward passes, the RBM will be trained, and a trained RBM can reveal which features are the most important ones when detecting patterns.   \n\n#### Why are RBMs important?\nIt can automatically extract __meaningful__ features from a given input.\n\n#### What are the applications of RBM?\nRBM is useful for <a href='http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~hinton/absps/netflixICML.pdf'>  Collaborative Filtering</a>, dimensionality reduction, classification, regression, feature learning, topic modeling and even __Deep Belief Networks__.\n\n\n\n#### Is RBM a generative model?\n\nRBM is a generative model. What is a generative model?\n\nFirst, lets see what is different betwee discriminative and generative model: \n\n__Discriminative:__Consider a classification problem in which we want to learn to distinguish between Sedan cars (y = 1) and SUV cars (y = 0), based on some features of an cars. Given a training set, an algorithm like logistic regression tries to find a straight line\u2014that is, a decision boundary\u2014that separates the suv and sedan. \n__Generative:__ looking at cars, we can build a model of what Sedan cars look like. Then, looking at SUVs, we can build a separate model of what SUV cars look like. Finally, to classify a new car, we\ncan match the new car against the Sedan model, and match it against the SUV model, to see whether the new car looks more like the SUV or Sedan. \n\nGenerative Models specify a probability distribution over a dataset of input vectors. we can do both supervise and unsupervise tasks with generative models:\n- In an unsupervised task, we try to form a model for P(x), where x is an input vector. \n- In the supervised task, we first form a model for P(x|y), where y is the label for x. For example, if y indicates whether an example is a SUV (0) or a Sedan (1), then p(x|y = 0) models the distribution of SUVs\u2019 features, and p(x|y = 1) models the distribution of Sedans\u2019 features. If we manage to find P(x|y) and P(y), then we can use `bayes rule` to estimate P(y|x), because: p(y|x) = p(x|y)p(y)/p(x)\n\nCan we build a generative model, and then use it to create synthetic data by directly sampling from the modelled probability distributions? Lets see. ",

MNIST images have 784 pixels, so the visible layer must have 784 input nodes. \n\nThe second layer is the __hidden__ layer, which possesses i neurons in our case. Each hidden unit has a binary state, which we\u2019ll call it __si__, and turns either on or off (i.e., si = 1 or si = 0) with a probability that is a logistic function of the inputs it receives from the other j visible units, called for example, p(si = 1). For our case, we'll use 500 nodes in the hidden layer, so i = 500.\n",

What RBM can do after training?\n\nThink RBM as a model that have been trained, and now it can calculate the probability of observing a case (e.g. wet road) given some hidden/latent values (e.g. raining). That is, the RBM can be viewed as a generative model that assigns a probability to each possible `binary state vectors` over its visible units (v). \n\nWhat are the possible __binary states vectors__? \n- The visible layer can have different binary states, or so called, configurations. For example, in the 7 unit visible layer (above photo), it has ${2^{7}}$ differnt configurations, and each configuration has its probablity (assuming we dont have any bias).\n    - (0,0,0,0,0,0,0) --> p(config1)=p(v1)=p(s1=0,s2=0, .., s7=0)\n    - (0,0,0,0,0,0,1) --> p(config2)=p(v2)=p(s1=0,s2=1, .., s7=1)\n    - (0,0,0,0,0,1,0) --> p(config3)=p(v3)=p(s1=1,s2=0, .., s7=0)\n    - (0,0,0,0,0,1,1) --> p(config4)=p(v4)=p(s1=1,s2=1, .., s7=1)\n    - etc.\n\n\nSo, for example if we have 784 units in the visible layer, it will generates a probability distribution over all the ${2^{784}}$ possible visible vectors, i.e, p(v). \n\nNow, it would be really cool, if a model (after training) can calculate the probablity of visible layer, given hidden layer values.\n\n## 5. How to train an RBM? \n\nRBM has two phases: 1) Forward Pass, and  2) Backward Pass or Reconstruction:\n\n\n__Phase 1) Forward pass:__  Processing happens in each node in the hidden layer. That is, input data from all visible nodes are being passed to all hidden nodes. This computation begins by making stochastic decisions about whether to transmit that input or not (i.e. to determine the state of each hidden layer). At the hidden layer's nodes, __X__ is multiplied by a __W__ and added to __h_bias__. The result of those two operations is fed into the sigmoid function, which produces the node\u2019s output/state. As a result, one output is produced for each hidden node. So, for each row in the training set, __a tensor of probabilities__ is generated, which in our case it is of size [1x500], and totally 55000 vectors (_h0_=[55000x500]).\n\n\nThen, we take the tensor of probabilities (as from a sigmoidal activation) and make samples from all the distributions, __h0__.  That is, we sample the activation vector from the probability distribution of hidden layer values. Samples are used to estimate the negative phase gradient which will be explained later.",

            "source": "<a id=\"ref4\"></a>\n### How to calculate gradients?\nIn order to train an RBM, we have to maximize the product of probabilities assigned to the training set V (a matrix, where each row of it is treated as a visible vector v):\n<img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/d42e9f5aad5e1a62b11b119c9315236383c1864a\" >\n\n\nOr equivalently, maximize the expected log probability of V:\n<img src=\"https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ba0ceed99dca5ff1d21e5ace23f5f2223f19efc0\" >\n\nEquivalently, we can define the objective function as __the average negative log-likelihood__ and try to minimize it. To achieve this, we need the partial derivative of this function in respect to all of its parameters. And it can be shown that the above equation is indirectly the weights and biases function, so minimization of the objective function here means modifying/optimizing the weight vector W. So, we can use __stochastic gradient descent__ to find the optimal weight and consequently minimize the objective function. When we derive, it give us 2 terms, called positive and negative gradient. These negative and positive phases reflect their effect on the probability density defined by the model. The positive one depends on observations (X), and the second one depends on only the model. \n \nThe __Positive phase__ increases the probability of training data.  \nThe __Negative phase__ decreases the probability of samples generated by the model.  \n\nThe negative phase is hard to compute, so we use a method called __Contrastive Divergence (CD)__ to approximate it.  It is designed in such a way that at least the direction of the gradient estimate is somewhat accurate, even when the size is not (In real world models, more accurate techniques like CD-k or PCD are used to train RBMs). During the calculation of CD, we have to use __Gibbs sampling__ to sample from our model distribution.    \n\nContrastive Divergence is actually matrix of values that is computed and used to adjust values of the W matrix. Changing W incrementally leads to training of W values. Then on each step (epoch), W is updated to a new value W' through the equation below:\n$W' = W + alpha * CD$ \n\n__ What is Alpha?__  \nHere, alpha is some small step rate and is also known as the \"learning rate\".\n\n__How can we calculate CD?__  \nWe can perform single-step Contrastive Divergence (CD-1) taking the following steps:\n\n1. Take a training sample from X, compute the probabilities of the hidden units and sample a hidden activation vector h0 from this probability distribution.\n - $\\_h0 = sigmoid(X \\otimes W + hb)$\n - $h0 = sampleProb(h0)$\n2. Compute the [outer product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_product) of X and h0 and call this the positive gradient.\n - $w\\_pos\\_grad = X \\otimes h0$  (Reconstruction in the first pass)  \n3. From h, reconstruct v1, and then take a sample of the visible units, then resample the hidden activations h1 from this. (**Gibbs sampling step**)\n - $\\_v1 = sigmoid(h0 \\otimes transpose(W) + vb)$\n - $v1 = sample_prob(v1)$  (Sample v given h)\n - $h1 = sigmoid(v1 \\otimes W + hb)$\n4. Compute the outer product of v1 and h1 and call this the negative gradient.\n - $w\\_neg\\_grad = v1 \\otimes h1$  (Reconstruction 1)\n5. Now, CD equals the positive gradient minus the - negative gradient, CD is a matrix of size 784x500. \n - $CD = (w\\_pos\\_grad - w\\_neg\\_grad) / datapoints$\n6. Update the weight to be CD times some learning rate\n - $W' = W + alpha*CD$\n7. At the end of the algorithm, the visible nodes will store the value of the sample.\n\n#### What is sampling here (sampleProb)?\nIn forward pass: We randomly set the values of each hi to be 1 with probability $sigmoid(v \\otimes W + hb)$.  \nIn reconstruction: We randomly set the values of each vi to be 1 with probability $ sigmoid(h \\otimes transpose(W) + vb)$.",

In this particular square, the gray color represents weight = 0, and the whiter it is, the more positive the weights are (closer to 1).

The positive pixels will increase the probability of activation in hidden units (after muliplying by input/visible pixels), and negative pixels will decrease the probability of a unit hidden to be 1 (activated).
